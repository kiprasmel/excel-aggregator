# TODO 

- [ ] lowercase matching
- [ ] latin-only alphabet for matching (match non-latin to latin if similar)
- [ ] perf: cache finder for sheet, e.g. for prefix finding if identical
- [ ] use CSVs instead of excel? had some bugs e.g. formula not being evaluated in full (e.g. division), thus giving incorrect data
